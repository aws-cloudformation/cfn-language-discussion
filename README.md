# CFN Language Discussion

## What is it?
This repo is a place to propose and discuss new language features for the CloudFormation template language. It is also a great place to request CFN language features, report CFN language bugs or any general discussion related to the CloudFormation template language.

## What is an RFC?

An RFC (request for comment) is a text document proposing a change to the CloudFormation template language. RFCs will only contain customer-facing syntax and behavior, not implementation details, and while we welcome all customer feedback on the proposal, the CloudFormation team will have final authority on decisions around the proposal.

### When should I write an RFC
You will need to draft an RFC when you propose a new language feature in CloudFormation template language. Examples are:

   - New intrinsic functions
   - New parameter types
   - New functionality for an existing intrinsic funtion.

### Who should submit an RFC
An RFC can be submitted by anyone. In most cases, RFCs are authored by CloudFormation team members, but contributors are more than welcome to submit RFCs.
