# Summary

Brief explanation of the feature.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

Please focus on explaining the motivation so that if this RFC is not accepted,
the motivation could be used to develop alternative solutions. In other words,
enumerate the constraints you are trying to solve without coupling them too
closely to the solution you have in mind.

There are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

# Example(s)

If the proposal involves a new feature, include a few code examples showing how this feature can be used.
Omit this section if it's not applicable.

# Limitation

- What are limitations of this feature?
- What are some limited use cases?

# Details

Please use this section to provide more information about the RFC.

- If the RFC is to propose a new intrinsic function, please include:
    - Function declaration.
    - Parameter definition.
    - Return value. (optional if shown in *example* section)
    - Other intrinsic functions supported by this function.
    - How does the new intrinsic function handle edge cases.

- If the RFC is to propose a new capability of an existing intrinsic function, please include:
    - New Function declaration. (If applicable)
    - New parameter definition. (If applicable)
    - New Return value. (If applicable)
    - New intrinsic functions supported by this function with new capability. (If applicable)
    - How does the new intrinsic function handle edge cases.
    - How does the intrinsic function maintain its backword compatibility with new capability.

- For any other RFCs, please include as many details as possible so reviewers have full context.
