# New Intrinsic Function to Convert Template Block to JSON String

* **Original Author(s):**: @mluk-aws
* **Tracking Issue**: [Tracking Issue](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-language-discussion/issues/14)

# Summary

We will support an intrinsic function called `Fn::ToJsonString` that enables developers to convert a template block into an escaped JSON string, which can be used as input values to string-type properties of CloudFormation resources.

# Examples

Here is an example of a resource containing a string-type property using a JSON formatted string.
```json
"MyDashboard": {
    "Type": "AWS::CloudWatch::Dashboard",
    "Properties": {
        "DashboardBody": "{\"start\":\"-PT6H\",\"periodOverride\":\"inherit\",\"widgets\":[{\"type\":\"text\",\"x\":0,\"y\":7,\"width\":3,\"height\":3,\"properties\":{\"markdown\":\"Hello world\"}}]}"
    }
}
```

With the new `Fn::ToJsonString` intrinsic function we can simplify to the following:

## JSON
```json
"MyDashboard": {
    "Type": "AWS::CloudWatch::Dashboard",
    "Properties": {
        "DashboardBody": {
            "Fn::ToJsonString": {
                "start": "-PT6H",
                "periodOverride": "inherit",
                "widgets": [
                    {  
                        "type": "text",
                        "x": 0,
                        "y": 7,
                        "width": 3,
                        "height": 3,
                        "properties": { "markdown": "Hello world" }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## YAML
```yaml
MyDashboard:
    Type: AWS::CloudWatch::Dashboard
    Properties:
        DashboardBody:
            Fn::ToJsonString:
                start: "-PT6H"
                periodOverride: inherit
                widgets:
                    - type: text
                    x: 0
                    y: 7
                    width: 3
                    height: 3
                    properties:
                        markdown: Hello world
```

### Short Form Syntax
```
MyDashboard:
    Type: AWS::CloudWatch::Dashboard
    Properties:
        DashboardBody:
            !ToJsonString:
                start: "-PT6H"
                periodOverride: inherit
                widgets:
                    - type: text
                    x: 0
                    y: 7
                    width: 3
                    height: 3
                    properties:
                        markdown: Hello world
```

# Motivation

A CloudFormation user may want to use JSON strings as input to a resource property. For example, `AWS::CloudWatch::Dashboard` requires a JSON string for the `DashboardBody` attribute. A user may even want to use a JSON string as input to attributes where only a general string is required, such as in `SecretString` of `AWS::SecretsManager::Secret`.

Today, this can only be accomplished through the use of external tools to convert object bodies to JSON strings, or use workarounds such as YAML multiline syntax. Having a feature to automate this transformation can provide various benefits, such as improving development workflow, improving code readability, or being able to utilize JSON/YAML syntax highlighting in text editors.

# Details

`Fn::ToJsonString` is an intrinsic function that takes in a template block as input and converts it into an escaped JSON string.

* It will be restricted to only be used as the value of string-type resource properties.
* Intrinsic functions (e.g. `Fn::If`, `Ref`) or pseudo parameters (e.g. `AWS::NoValue`) can be used within the input template block. The input template block will be processed by the intrinsic functions and pseudo parameters before it is converted to a string (i.e. the resolved value of the intrinsic function is converted to the output string, and not the intrinsic function itself).
* Conversion will always retain the same order of key-value pairs such that the converted strings of the same input template block are guaranteed to not change.
* The following pseudo parameters will be supported:
    * `AWS::AccountId`, `AWS::Region`, `AWS::Partition`, `AWS::NoValue`

# Limitation

* YAML is a superset of JSON, so there are a few features in YAML that can not be converted to JSON due to their differences. For example, comments are supported in YAML but not JSON. This can potentially be a confusing developer experience if the developer is not aware of these limitations and have different expectations.
* Unsupported pseudo parameters:
    * `AWS::StackId`, `AWS::StackName`, `AWS::NotificationArns`, `AWS::URLSuffix`

# FAQ
* Will the CloudFormation Linter (cfn-lint) support validations regarding Fn::ToJsonString?
    * Yes. It needs to validate that itâ€™s only used for string-type resource properties, and that the input template block is valid.
